# Initial Code Description

`code/00_clean_data.R`  
- Reads raw data from `raw_data/heart.csv`  
- Applies variable labels and saves a cleaned dataset to
`output/clean_data.rds`

`code/01_make_table1.R`  
- Reads the cleaned data  
- Creates a descriptive summary table using `gtsummary`  
- Saves the table as `output/table_one.rds`

`code/02_make_box.R`  
- Reads the cleaned data  
- Creates a boxplot of age by heart-disease status using `ggplot2`  
- Saves the figure as `output/boxplot.png`

`code/render_report.R`  
- Renders the final report from `report.Rmd`  
- Produces `report.html` as the final output

`report.Rmd`  
- Combines the summary table and figure into a final written report  
- Interprets results from the dataset

`Makefile`  
- Contains rules for building the full analysis and final report  
- `make` runs the entire workflow: cleans data, generates table and
figure, and renders the report  
- `make clean` removes intermediate output files

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Generating Final Report

To reproduce the full workflow and render the final report:

1.  Open the project folder in RStudio or your terminal.  
2.  Make sure the required R packages are installed:  
    `here`, `readr`, `labelled`, `gtsummary`, `ggplot2`, `rmarkdown`  
3.  In the terminal, run: make This command will run all the steps and
    generate the `report.html`

# Output Files

The `output/` folder contains generated results from the analysis
pipeline: - `boxplot.png`: final figure showing the distribution of age
by heart-disease status  
- `.gitkeep`: placeholder file was used to ensure the directory
structure remains visible in GitHub

# Synchronizing the Package Repository

This project uses `renv` to ensure reproducible R package environment.
After cloning the repository, run the following command: `make install`

This will automatically restore all required R packages using the
`renv.lock` file
